<!-- Edit the HTML file to include 5 buttons – each one will pick a random phrase from a
JavaScript array (use the image on the last page of this assignment to build each of the
five arrays). Note that the first column is a list of nouns (forming the sentence subject),
the second is a list of verbs, the third is a list of adjectives, the fourth, another list of
nouns, and the fifth consists of a number of places (or settings).
5. The user will push each of the buttons, and each will concatentate the random word
from it’s array, eventually building the text string that will be assigned to the variable
textToSpeak.
6. Create a sixth button that will actually pass the value to textToSpeak to the
speakNow() function (this part of the assignment is already built for you). -->
